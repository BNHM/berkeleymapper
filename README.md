BerkeleyMapper 2.0 is a mapping interface for Collections (or other) Databases built on top of Google Maps.  Users can configure their mapping interface through a simple XML configuration script while mapping data from tab-delimited text files.

This codebase is in active development, with many new features and interface changes from the prior version.  The BerkeleyMapper instance running at http://berkeleymapper.berkeley.edu is open to anyone mapping natural history collections data.  The code is open source, so you may wish to setup your own instance running on another server. If you have any questions or feature requests please email the developer at "jdeck -at- berkeley -dot- edu"
