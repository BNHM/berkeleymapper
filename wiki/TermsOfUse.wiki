= Disclaimer about Mapped Data and Metadata =

BerkeleyMapper displays content that is generated on external websites.  Metadata, including Latitude and Longitude values, are passed to BerkeleyMapper, which in turn takes this data and plots it on a map.  In cases where points are not correctly mapped, taxonomic names are incorrect, or any other metadata is incorrect, the issue most likely originated from the website that you used to call BerkeleyMapper.  Feedback on suspected data issues should be directed to the maintainers of the calling website and not BerkeleyMapper.
